# Better Stage

**WARNING! This mod is still untested, and it has a ton of moving parts and gears, here be dragons**

![/Mods/Stage/Better%20Stage/render.png](/Mods/Stage/Better%20Stage/render.png)

This mod addresses some major useability downside with the twin M5 screw movement of the standard module.
The independent rack and pinion movement for x and y prevent the binding issue of the two interconnected knobs, and the new gears incorporate springs in order to eliminate backlash and shake inherent with the design of the basic module.

Despite being more complex, it is also much easier to assemble and maintain.

## Bill of Materials

**This mod replaces the entire stage module, you will be able to recover only the clips and screws of the stage, therefore they are not listed in the BOM, and you may be able to recylce the PTFE tube if you can cut it and use it for the short backers without it bending out of shape**

- One set of printed parts, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope.  

- 7x M3 locknuts.

- 5x M3x___ for adjusting the rails

- 2x M3x___ for holding the knobs

- about ___ cm of PTFE tube

- 6x 8x20 bed leveling springs
  
- super glue
