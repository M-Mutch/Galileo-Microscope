# Micro 4/3 camera adapter

This adapter allows to attach a Micro 4/3 camera (tested with an OM-D E-M5 mkII) in place of the 23.4 mm eyepiece of the microscope.

For best results, enable the silent/electronic shutter with a 2 seconds delay, otherwise the kick of the mechanical shutter is enough to compromise the crispness of the image.

## Bill of Materials

- One set of printed parts, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope.
The block serves to latch on the lens release pin, and it is technically optional but it does help better securing the adapter.

>[!TIP]
>The fitting inside the camera body is intentionally tight, if you print it and it doesn't fit, you may have a hint of elephant foot, clean up the bottom with a deburring tool and/or sand it down a little bit.

- 3x M3x8 mm SHCS screws 

## Assembling

- Thread the three screws in the holes around the perimeter of the adapter.
Be careful as you are threading in plastic, you can stop 1 mm before the head of the screw bottoms out. 

- Push the block down in the square slot, with the flatter side of the prongs facing towards the lips of the flange, press until the top of the square plug is flush with the top of the disk. You may need to cut and file it a bit, especially if you had a bit of elephant foot, but we are going for a permanent friction fit, so if it gets stuck all the better, as soon as it goes all the way down.
