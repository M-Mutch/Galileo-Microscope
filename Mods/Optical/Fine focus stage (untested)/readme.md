### Fine focusing stage

![/Mods/Optical/Fine%20focus%20stage%20(untested)/render.png](/Mods/Optical/Fine%20focus%20stage%20(untested)/render.png)

This modified stage allows a movement of about 0.6 mm moving the control lever over the span of about 75Â°.
For reference, it corresponds to 1/6 of a turn of the coarse focusing wheel using the defasult 3.8 mm pitch thread.
You can modify the CAD file to increase the slope and get a coarser movement, while I do not recommend going much lower than that, even if decreasing the layer height of your print you theoretically could.

Mechanically, this is achieved by sliding a disk with sloped surfaces in order to lift the entire main focuser mechanism, while springs in the three corners keep the system under tension and prevent binding.



## Bill of Materials

- One each of the STLs, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope

- 3x 8x20 mm springs, same as those used in the standard focusing knob

- 3x M3x40 mm SHCS screws and M3 nuts

- 1x M3x50 mm SHCS screw, one M3 nut and 2x M3 locknuts    

- 4mm diameter PTFE tube (bowden), about 120 cm in total.

- 3x M5x12 SHCS screws and nuts for locking the pipes (if you upgrade an existing spider you will recycle these).

>[!NOTE]
>The M3x50 can be replaced with one a bit shorter or longer, but consider that if it is shorter you may not be able to bottom it out, losing some leverage and/or limiting the available travel as the knob bumps in the spider (you could forego the knob but that would be barbaric); if the screw is longer you will get better leverage and finer control as the horizontal travel per vertical displacement increases, but at the cost of increasing the footprint and possibly introducing wobble as the longer lever will want to bend more than a shorter one.

## Assembling

- Remove the sacrificial layers from the three corners of the spider body, there is one in the roof of the spring wells, and one closing the nut slots in the bottom. Punch through them with an M3 screw and clear any burrs.
