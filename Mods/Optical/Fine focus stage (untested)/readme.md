This modified stage allows a movement of about 0.6 mm moving the control lever over the span of about 75Â°.

For reference, it corresponds to 1/6 of a turn of the coarse focusing wheel using the default 3.8 mm pitch thread.
You can modify the CAD file to increase the slope and get a different movement range, within reason.

Mechanically, this is achieved by sliding a disk with sloped surfaces in order to lift the entire main focuser mechanism, while springs in the three corners keep the system under tension and prevent binding.

## Bill of Materials

**This mod only changes the spider of the standard focuser, please refer to that BOM and instructions for the common parts, below is only what you will need specifically for this mod.**

- One each of the STLs, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope

- 3x 8x20 mm springs, same as those used in the standard focusing knob

- 3x M3x40 mm SHCS screws and M3 lock nuts

- 1x M3x50 mm SHCS screw, one M3 nut and 2x M3 locknuts    

- 4mm diameter PTFE tube (bowden), about 55 cm in total.

- 3x M5x12 SHCS screws and nuts for locking the pipes (if you upgrade an existing spider you will recycle these).

>[!NOTE]
>The M3x50 can be replaced with one a bit shorter or longer, but consider that if it is shorter you may not be able to bottom it out, losing some leverage and/or limiting the available travel as the knob bumps in the spider (you could forego the knob but that would be barbaric); if the screw is longer you will get better leverage and finer control as the horizontal travel per vertical displacement increases, but at the cost of increasing the footprint and possibly introducing wobble as the longer lever will want to bend more than a shorter one.

## Assembling

![/Mods/Optical/Fine%20focus%20stage/section.png](/Mods/Optical/Fine%20focus%20stage/section.png)

- Remove the sacrificial layers from the three corners of the spider body, closing the nut slots in the bottom. Punch through them with an M3 screw and clear any burrs.

- Insert six spans of PTFE tube in the grooves of the spider body, they will provide an even slope instead of the inevitable "stairs" effect of the printed layers.   The tube should snap fit in the slot, push it one section at a time pressing down with a spoon going around the circle, cut off the excess when you get close to the end, cut as close as possible to the end of the groove, but avoid longer ends bumping and pushing out. 

- Insert the M3 nut in the rotor (it goes in flat side down, unlike corner down as usual) and the M3x50 screw in the knob, then join them. Make sure the screw bottoms out in the pit which goes all the way trough the depth of the rotor.

- Place the rotor in the cradle of the spider body, followed by the nachelle. make sure the rotor spins freely against both, and if in doubt add some grease especially in the pit between spider and rotor, where it won't risk getting in your hands during use anyways.

>[!TIP]
>Add now the M5 nuts and screws in the corners too, before positioning the nachelle.

- Drop the springs in the pits on the three corners, then the spring retainers. Use M3x40 and locknuts in the pits on the bottom of the spider to keep everything together. 

- Adjust the precharge of the springs, they must not be too compressed, and they must press down evenly.  

- Proceed with the assembling of the other components and installation on the pipes, same as the standard optical module.

>[!TIP]
>This is when you have to decide where you want the lever to point in relation to the microscope. Having it inm front is not in fact very comfortable, try placing it at the back right or back left depending on wether you are right handed or left handed, it is actually more natural as you keep your hands around the microscope.
