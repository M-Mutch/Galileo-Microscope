Printing Instructions for the Crayford Focuser

Items marked with [a] are designated as accent, all others are primary colour.

All these items are designed to be printed without supports however on the Focuser_Body_x1.stl there is a in built support than needs to be removed afterwards 
it is where the Bearing_Block_x1.stl is fitted, it should be easily removable and leave minimal signs it was there and can be disposed of.
