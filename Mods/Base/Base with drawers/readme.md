# Base with drawers

**WARNING! This mod is still untested, I don't foresee anything possibly going wrong with a design this simple, but still...**

## Bill of Materials

**This mod only replaces the design of the base module adding some internal space, screws for the rubber feet and for locking the pipes are unchanged froom the standard version.**

- One set of printed parts, printed using the same settings as the rest of the microscope.  
There is an option for either the normal drawers with slots in the bottom for magnets, or simpler darwers to just print in vase mode.  

>You can use the "storage_height" parameter in the CAD file to adjust to taste, I pre-generated 60 mm and 30 mm versions. The 60 mm version is best for storing objectives, 30 mm is enough for a pack f slides, and other small items.
>There are "magnet_diameter" and "magnet_thickness" parameters as well if you happen to have a different magnet size at hand (if they are thicker than 3mm, you should also offset the bottom or you will poke a hole in it).    

- 2-6 3x8 mm magnets, each drawer has slots for 1 to 3 magnets, use as many as you prefer.  

- super glue  

## Assembling

Nothing to see here, just glue the magnets in place, add the M3 nuts for the rubber feet, slide in the rods, and secure them with the screws as for the standard base module.

>The only caveat I can think of, is that wehre on the standard base you could use longer screws for the rubber feet, and at worst you would have to cut a dent in the cover to make it fit, here a longer screw will interfere with the drawers.  
>If the correct screws are not available, you will have to cut them short or space them from below with washers or 3d printing a small buffer disk.
