# MICROstack modular microscope

# MICROwhat?
This project is about an affordable, expandable and customizeable microscope based around basic hardware and 3d printing.
The structure is based on three vertical posts, that support a "stack" of independent modules for the various functions of a microscope, so that each can be modified and upgraded easily.
