# MICROwhat?
This project is about an affordable, expandable and customizeable microscope based around basic hardware and 3d printing.
The structure is based on three vertical posts, that support a "stack" of independent modules for the various functions of a microscope, so that each can be modified and upgraded easily.

# Basic specification
The core of the structure is formed by the three vertical rods of 12 mm diameter, in an equilateral triangle arrangement of 120 mm diameter (between the center of the rods), with an external perimeter another 10 mm out, making the base module diameter 140 mm.
That's about it, there is no limit on how tall each "layer should be", nor on how tall the rods would be within reason, so if you have an idea for a killer lighitng setup, all you should do is see if it fits in a 140 mm diameter cylinder shape (minus the space for the rods).
