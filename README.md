# MICROwhat?
This project is about an affordable, expandable and customizeable microscope based around basic hardware and 3d printing.


# Core specification
The core of the structure is formed by the three vertical rods of 12 mm diameter, in an equilateral triangle arrangement of 140 mm diameter (between the centers), with an external perimeter of another 10 mm all around, making the base module diameter 160 mm.
That's about it, there is no limit on how tall each "layer" should be, on the number of layers, nor on the lenght of the rods, so if you have an idea for a particular lighitng setup, a finer stage module, or something else entirely, all you should do is fit it in a 160 mm diameter cylinder shape (minus the space for the rods).

# Base modules
The basic implementation consists of the following modules:
- Base (basically a dish filled with ballast)
- Lighting (bring your own), slide a phone in with the torch on
- Stage
- Standoffs (either simple or clip on, if you have different objectives and the focused doesn't cover the whole range for all of them)
- Optical group (this is the only one a bit more complex to put together, but nothing scary)
- Phone holder to take pictures and brag about your new microscope
