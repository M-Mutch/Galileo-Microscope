## 3d printed parts

Please read the [Printing and assembling](/Printing_and_assembling.md) file, there are a couple variants to choose from, and some tips about printing.

## Generic hardware

- 3x 20 cm aluminum pipes spans, 12 mm diameter 
Wood or other materials would also work, as long as the diameter is correct.

- 6x M5x12 SHCS screws and nuts for locking the pipes

- 2x M5x80 hexagon head bolts, 2x M5 lock nuts and 4x M5 washers for the stage movement.  You can also use M5 threaded rod 90 mm length instead of the bolts, but you will need 2 more locknuts and 2x M5 cap nuts.

- 3x M3x30 SHCS screws and nuts for the anti backlash ring

- 2x M3x12 SHCS screws for the slide holder

- Superlube grease or similar

- Superglue

- A bit of oven paper or similar, or a 25 mm diameter disk of 3 mm frosted acrylic if you are feeling dapper

### 3D printing related hardware

- PTFE tube (Bowden), 4 mm diameter, about 10 cm 

- 3x 8x20 mm bed leveling springs, the generic yellow ones
These also exist in 25 mm version, they may work as well, just precharge the anti backlash ring one less turn, it will eat 5 mm of travel to your focuser, wether this is a problem depends on your objectives, I don't have data to tell. 

### Microscope specific hardware
- at least one objective, with standard RMS thread, if in doubt start with a 4x one 
- at least one eyepiece, 23.2 mm tube diameter, if in doubt start with a 10x eyeglasses friendly
- a pair of stage clips, the standard type which comes with M3 screws for installation
- a pack of slides and cover slips

### Tools
- Allen keys matching the screw heads
- Metal saw for the aluminum tube
- having Sandpaper around never hurts, but it should not be necessary. 

>[!NOTE]
>The microscope has been designed and tested around cheap optics from Amazon, using better components will definitely make a difference but if you are in doubt wether to commit money to this project, there is no shame in starting cheap.  
>Here is an example of what 25,00 Euros of glass can do already (4x objective 10x eyepiece, the small notches are 0.01 mm)
