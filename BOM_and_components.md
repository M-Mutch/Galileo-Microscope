## 3d printed parts

Please read the [Printing and assembling](/Printing_and_assembling.md) file, there are a couple variants to choose from, and some tips about printing.

Purchasing-wise, one spool of either PLA or PETG should be enough to complete the project, but the result will be boring, I suggest a two color scheme (one for the structure and another one for the gears and knobs), plus there are the optional TPU feet.

## Generic hardware

- 3x 20 cm aluminum pipes spans, 12 mm diameter 
Wood or other materials would also work, as long as the material is rigid and the diameter is correct.

- 6x M5x12 SHCS screws and nuts for locking the pipes

- 2x M5x80 hexagon head bolts, 2x M5 lock nuts and 4x M5 washers for the stage movement.  You can also use M5 threaded rod 90 mm length instead of the bolts, but you will need 2 more locknuts and 2x M5 cap nuts, having done it, I do not recommend it.

- 3x M3x30 SHCS screws and M3 nuts for the anti backlash ring

- 2x M3x12 SHCS screws for the slide backers

- Superlube grease or similar, oil may or may not work, I think grease is better and easier to manage, you will have to glue parts next to greased surfaces, so it would be better if it doesn't spill.

- Superglue, there is debate on wether cyanaclrilate sticks to PETG, experiment if needed, but it is not dramatic if it fails.

- A bit of oven paper or similar, or a 25 mm diameter disk of 3 mm frosted acrylic if you are feeling dapper. This will cover the hole between stage and illumination.

### 3D printing related hardware

- PTFE tube (Bowden), 4 mm diameter, about 10 cm (optional, but used to allow the stage to slide around better), it will be finnicky to place it afterwards so I do recommend installing it from the start.

- 3x 8x20 mm bed leveling springs, the generic yellow ones.  
These also exist in 25 mm version, they may work as well, just precharge the anti backlash ring one less turn, it will eat 5 mm of travel to your focuser, wether this is a problem depends on your objectives, I don't have data to tell. 

### Microscope specific hardware

- at least one objective, with standard RMS thread, if in doubt start with a 4x one

- at least one eyepiece, 23.2 mm tube diameter, if in doubt start with a 10x eyeglasses friendly

- a pair of stage clips, the standard type which comes with M3 screws for installation

- a pack of slides and cover slips


### Tools

- Allen keys matching the screw heads

- an open wrench matching the M5 lock nuts

- Metal saw for the aluminum tube

- having Sandpaper (or a dremel) around never hurts, but it should not be necessary. 



>[!NOTE]
>The microscope has been designed and tested around cheap optics from Amazon, using better components will definitely make a difference but if you are in doubt wether to commit money to this project, there is no shame in starting cheap.  
>Here is an example of what 25,00 Euros of glass can do already (4x objective 10x eyepiece, the small notches are 0.01 mm)
