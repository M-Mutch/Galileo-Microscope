# Printing and assembling

The following instructions cover the basic modules, over time some alternatives and mods may become available, so while the basic principles will still apply, it is always a good idea to check wether variants of the various modules have appeared, and how you may want to incorporate them in your build.

In particular your objective will need a specific focus tube lenghts, the DIN standard has a 160 mm tube, the JIS standard has a 170 mm tube. Choose yours accordingly and note that the threaded tube in the STLs are 5 mm shorter but that's correct, the objective holder nut adds the missing 5 mm.

## Printing tips

### Materials

The microscope is not subject to heat (unless something goes horribly wrong with the lighting module or you put something reactive on the stage.

All prototyping has been done in PETG, the extra rigidity and general easier printing of PLA should only improve the results, ABS may be both overkill and introduce some unexpected tolerance issues due to shrinking, I do not recommend it, but I may revise this paragraph if sufficient empyrical results emerge from people trying it none the less.

### Settings

Print with a 0.4 mm nozzle at 0.20 mm layer height.
I used these Settingssuccesfully for the parts with threads as well, but going lower for those cannot hurt if you feel like it.  

A high infill will add to the overall rigidity of the parts, prototyping and testing has been done with 4 walls and 40% infill, you can probably get away with less on the lower modules, but I would nt skimp on the spider, and on any of the gears. 

The STLs are already oriented for printing without supports, but some items like the focus tube and the standoffs do require a brim ulness your bed adhesion is exceptional, so you should add it at your discretion.
The focus tube has a bevel at the extremities, it helps it not to bind towards the bottom of the objective nut, and it will soak up any imperfection as you clena up the brim, but using a deburring tool and doing a clean job is still a good idea.

>[!TIP] Do a couple test prints.  
>Print the objective holder nut and a 40 mm section of the focusing tube using the plane cut function of your slicer to test the thread, stiff is ok (it will wear itself down and you will add some grease where it matters), hard binds on the other hand may be a showstopper.   
>Don't print all at once the parts with nut holes, you don't want to spend half a spool of plastic then discover that your hardware won't fit, the same applies to the pipe holes in the modules. The base module is a good place to start since it has the holes for the pipes, vertical M5 and horizontal M3 nut pits, so you already have a bit of everything.

## Assembling

Each module is assembled separatey, then you can simply stack them along the vertical rods and tighten the screws on the base and spider modules.
You can use one of the rods to "break in" the holes of each module beforehand, so that the stacking will be smoother.
